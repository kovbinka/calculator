# Backlog

The backlog includes all tasks and features required to complete the simple calculator
project. It outlines basic features, prioritized by importance.

## Main page

### Must-Haves

> these are necessary for basic usability

- As a user, I need just a readable `input` with the calculating result.
- As a user, I need a `buttons` with numbers to start entering values.
- As a user, I need useful `buttons` with math operators to calculate the value.

### Should-Haves

> these will complete the user experience, but are not necessary

- As a user I want to see some `buttons` with advanced calculator functions,
  so I can calculate more complex values.

### Could-Haves

> would be really cool ... if there's time

- As a user I want to see some `video links` so I can call an ai-assistant to
  find the answer to the question of what formulas to use to determine certain tasks.
